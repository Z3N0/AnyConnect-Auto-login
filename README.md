# AnyConnectAuto 
wtf is this?
Its a Powershell script for autologon of cisco anyconnect. you can use it if your IT department gives you just enough access to use their cisco anyconnect vpn, to which they have no service ("smartnet" at the time of this writing) from cisco, dont know how or dont want to use the profile editor or anything at all to automaticaly login to a vpn connection. 
It includes shortcuts that can be placed into the windows startup folder. you know why you might want this, or not.
I dont care if you think auto connecting to a vpn is a bad idea.
